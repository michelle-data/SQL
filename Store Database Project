#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify information about store invoices. 

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in France 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "France"

#2.	Show only the Customers from the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "USA"

#3.	Find the Invoices of customers who are from Germany. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.CustomerID, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices i 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.CustomerID=c.CustomerID
WHERE c.Country = "Germany"

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"

#5.	Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT(BillingCountry) FROM chinook.invoices

#6.	How many Invoices were there in 2011?
SELECT COUNT(invoiceID) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2011%'

#7.	What are the total sales for 2013?
SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2013%'

#8.	Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineID FROM chinook.invoice_items i
INNER JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.TrackID =t.TrackID

#9.	Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS Track_Name, a.Title AS Album_Name, m.Name AS Media_Type, g.Name AS Genre FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.AlbumId=a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.MediaTypeId=m.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g 
ON t.GenreId=g.GenreID
